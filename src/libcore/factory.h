     * \brief The Factory class exists for creation of some important classes that may significantly differ based on the
     *                          implementation of the program. Some of these classes may need to be wrapped inside of other
     *                          class or some superclass. For this reason they are created using this factory using virtual
     *                          functions. In case you need to alter the way how these classes are created, eg. hook to the
     *                          creation process and do something special or create them in a different way, you may create
     *                          your own factory and replace the default by calling Core::InstallFactory
     *
     *                          This is especially usefull for network synchronization of class instantiation and so on
