# This is a very primitive scripting interface which can only handle basic commands
# You can also use couple of variables within here:

# $grumpy.paths.script           Path where system wide scripts should be present
# $grumpy.paths.extension        Path where system wide extensions should be present
# $grumpy.paths.home             Home path, user specific config and files
# $grumpy.paths.home.script      User scripts
# $grumpy.paths.home.extension   User extensions

# If you want to extend grumpy with custom JavaScript (ECMA) scripts, you can use this:
# /grumpy.script.load /full/path/to/a/script.js
# example: /grumpy.script.load $grumpy.paths.home.script/script.js

# For full documentation check https://github.com/grumpy-irc/grumpy/wiki/Scripting
